# numpy_freeBoundary_171112 (Nov. 18, 2017)

The code finds triangles not hidden by other triangles (defined herein as '**free triagnels**'). 
The code reads triangle incides (incides of vertices) of tetrahedra, then outputs incides of free triagnels.

The code uses:

- Python (tested on Python 3.5.2)
- Numpy (tested on Numpy v1.13.1)
- tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS desktop amd64

Test run can be executed as follows:

```bash
$ python3 freeBoundary_171112.py > log_171118.txt
``` 

See `log_17118.txt` in the repository.
